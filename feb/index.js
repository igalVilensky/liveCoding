/* Write a function that accepts several parameters and calculates the number of money that will have been saved as pension until a person retires. 
The function should be self invoked and should have the following parameters:
The current age of the person // e.g. 40
The retirement age of the person // e.g. 60
The monthly wage the person earns // e.g. 1000
The percentage (as integer) that the person saves each month // e.g. 10%
If the person has already retired then the message â€˜Youâ€™re already retired!â€™ should be printed. 
If not, then the program should calculate how many years remain until the person retires, the monthly income and take a specific percent of this income every month as saved money.
Example: A lady is 40 years old, she retires at 65, she earns $2000 per month and she saves the 5% of it. How much money will she have saved until she retires?
Output: $30000 */
